# illGoDeObThem

A self-hosted iOS/Android reverse-engineering workbench. Upload an `.ipa` or
`.apk` and get a Hopper/JADX-style browser for it — a switcher at the top of
the page ("🍎 iOSDeOb" / "🤖 AndroidDeOb") flips between the two, each with its
own scan list:

- **iOS (`.ipa`)**: unzipped bundle contents, an Objective-C class/method
  tree, ARM64 disassembly with a Ghidra-backed pseudo-C decompiler, scan
  comparison, and Frida-based dynamic instrumentation against a real device.
- **Android (`.apk`)**: unzipped APK contents, a parsed AndroidManifest.xml,
  a DEX class/method/field tree, JADX-decompiled Java + smali disassembly
  per class, and scan comparison. See [Android support](#android-support)
  for what's not there yet (dynamic analysis, MCP tools).

Both platforms also expose their analysis to AI agents — see
[Setting up the MCP server](#4-optional-set-up-the-mcp-server) (currently
iOS-only; Android MCP tools are a planned follow-up).

Built for de-obfuscating and understanding IPAs/APKs you own or are
explicitly authorized to test — see [Responsible use](#responsible-use).

## Features

- **File browser** — the unpacked `Payload/*.app` tree, Info.plist and
  entitlements parsed and rendered, previews for text/plist/image files, raw
  download for anything else.
- **Objective-C class browser** — every class, its superclass, methods
  (instance + class), properties, ivars and protocols, parsed straight from
  Mach-O load commands and ObjC runtime metadata (no `class-dump` dependency).
  Deep-links from a method straight into its disassembly.
- **ARM64 disassembly + decompiler** — on-demand `radare2` disassembly and
  Ghidra pseudo-C decompilation per function, with caller/callee cross-refs
  resolved against the class and symbol tables. Results are cached so
  re-opening a function is instant.
- **Search** — function/symbol and file-path search across the whole scan,
  plus a global cross-scan search from the header.
- **Scan comparison** — pick two scans and see exactly what differs: files
  added/removed/resized, classes added/removed/changed, functions
  added/removed.
- **Dynamic analysis (Frida)** — install/run the app on a jailbroken device
  you control (pick it from a device dropdown — USB is auto-detected, or add
  one wirelessly by its `host:port`) and trace it live: Objective-C method
  calls on classes you pick, outgoing network requests
  (URL/method/headers/body), and keychain/CommonCrypto/TLS-trust-evaluation
  checkpoints — plus **your own custom Frida script**, uploaded through the
  UI and run alongside the built-in hooks in its own isolated script
  instance. This piece runs natively on your Mac, not in Docker, and is
  entirely optional/additive — see [Setting up dynamic analysis](#3-optional-set-up-dynamic-analysis-frida-bridge).
- **MCP server** — exposes the same analysis (upload, file tree, classes,
  functions, decompiled pseudo-C) as MCP tools, so Claude Code, Claude
  Desktop, or any other MCP client can upload an IPA and reason about what
  it does — see [Setting up the MCP server](#4-optional-set-up-the-mcp-server).
  IPA/iOS only for now.

## Android support

Switch to "🤖 AndroidDeOb" at the top of the page and drop an `.apk`. Static
analysis parity with the iOS side: file browser, a parsed
AndroidManifest.xml (package, permissions, components, SDK levels), a
DEX class browser (methods/fields/access flags for every app-defined
class), and scan comparison across two APK uploads.

Selecting a class triggers on-demand decompilation — the same "click it,
watch it decompile, then it's cached" model as iOS's function disassembly —
via [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) for Java and
[apktool](https://apktool.org/) for smali, shown side by side. JADX genuinely
only processes the one class you clicked; apktool has no equivalent
single-class mode, so the smali side costs a full (but fast) dex
disassembly on whichever class you open first.

**Not yet built** — both are natural follow-ups, not fundamental limitations:
- **Dynamic analysis (Frida)** — Frida itself supports Android, but Java
  method tracing needs its own hook design, separate from `frida-bridge`'s
  ObjC-specific one.
- **MCP tools** — `mcp-server` currently only exposes the iOS analysis.

## Architecture

```
proxy           (Caddy)             — TLS/reverse-proxy, the only port you talk to (8080)
web             (React + TypeScript)— the SPA (iOS + Android, switched in the UI)
api             (FastAPI)           — uploads, SQLite persistence, job orchestration
worker          (Celery)            — the ONLY thing that touches untrusted IPAs;
                                       fully network-isolated, never executes them —
                                       extraction, ObjC/Mach-O parsing, r2/Ghidra calls
worker-android  (Celery)            — the Android analog of `worker`, same isolation
                                       posture — extraction, androguard manifest/DEX
                                       parsing, JADX decompile, apktool smali
redis                                — Celery broker (shared by both workers, separate queues)
```

`worker`/`worker-android` run on an internal, egress-free Docker network with
a read-only root filesystem — they parse untrusted binaries but never
execute them.

Two more pieces run **outside** Docker, directly on your Mac, and are both
entirely optional:

- **`frida-bridge`** (dynamic analysis) — needs real USB access to a
  jailbroken device, which Docker Desktop can't pass through to a container.
  It's a second Celery worker consuming a separate queue the containerized
  `worker` never listens on.
- **`mcp-server`** — a plain Python process your MCP client launches
  directly; it just makes the same HTTP calls to the API that your browser
  does.

If you never set either of these up, the rest of the app works exactly the
same.

## Project layout

```
api/            FastAPI backend — routes, models, schemas (both iOS and Android)
worker/         Celery worker that does the iOS static analysis (Docker)
worker-android/ Celery worker that does the Android static analysis (Docker)
web/            React + TypeScript frontend (iOS + Android, switched in the UI)
proxy/          Caddy config (the reverse proxy in front of everything)
frida-bridge/   Dynamic-analysis worker — runs on your host, not in Docker (iOS only)
mcp-server/     MCP server — also runs on your host (iOS only)
docker-compose.yml   Defines proxy/web/api/worker/worker-android/redis
```

## Prerequisites

- **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** —
  required for everything except dynamic analysis and the MCP server.
- **macOS** — `frida-bridge` (dynamic analysis) specifically needs macOS for
  USB device access; the rest of the stack is platform-agnostic.
- **Git**.
- For dynamic analysis only: **Python 3.10+**, **Node.js + npm**, and a
  **jailbroken iOS device** with `frida-server` installed on it.
- For the MCP server only: **Python 3.10+** and an MCP-compatible client
  (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.).

Throughout this guide, `/path/to/iOSDeOb` means wherever you clone this repo
— run `pwd` from the project root any time you need the real value.

## 1. Get the app running

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url> iOSDeOb
cd iOSDeOb
```

(Optional) set a non-default internal auth token — this is the shared
secret the API and its background workers use to talk to each other
internally; the stack works fine with the default, but don't reuse the
default if this will be reachable by anyone other than you:

```bash
echo "INTERNAL_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .env
```

Build and start everything:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

First build pulls a handful of base images, compiles `radare2`/`r2ghidra` in
the `worker` image, and downloads a JDK + JADX + apktool into the
`worker-android` image — expect several minutes the first time, and
**1.5–3GB images** for both, which is normal for bundled RE tooling.

## 2. Verify it's up

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** in a browser, upload a test `.ipa` (a
dev-signed or ad-hoc build — see [Known limitations](#known-limitations) for
why a straight-from-App-Store one won't work), and confirm it reaches
`ready` status, then browse its Files/Classes/Functions tabs. Switch to
"🤖 AndroidDeOb" at the top and try the same with a test `.apk` — any APK
works there, no signing caveat.

If port `8080` (or `8000`/`6379`, which `api`/`redis` also publish to
`127.0.0.1`) is already used by something else on your machine, Docker will
fail to start that service — see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## 3. (Optional) Set up dynamic analysis (frida-bridge)

Skip this section entirely if you don't need to trace a live app on a
device — everything above already works without it.

```bash
cd frida-bridge
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Check your device's `frida-server` version first** — the `frida` pin in
`requirements.txt` must match it exactly, or every real call fails with
`unable to communicate with remote frida-server; please ensure that major
versions match`. Check via your jailbreak tweak manager (Sileo/Zebra —
search "frida") or `frida-server --version` over on-device SSH, then update
the version pin in `requirements.txt` if it differs before running
`pip install`.

Confirm the device is visible (run directly in a terminal, not through a
script — it needs a real TTY):

```bash
frida-ls-devices
```

Build the injected agent (needs Node/npm):

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Start the worker — leave this running in its own terminal tab:

```bash
export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
export API_INTERNAL_URL=http://localhost:8000
export INTERNAL_TOKEN=dev-internal-token-change-me   # match your .env if you set one
celery -A bridge.celery_app worker -Q frida --pool=solo --loglevel=INFO
```

Then open the **"🧬 Dynamic analysis"** page from the app's header. Full
details — picking/adding devices (including wireless via an SSH tunnel),
what gets captured, custom scripts, and troubleshooting — are in
[frida-bridge/README.md](frida-bridge/README.md).

## 4. (Optional) Set up the MCP server

Skip this if you don't use an MCP-compatible AI client.

```bash
cd mcp-server
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With the Docker stack running, open the **"🔌 MCP setup"** button in the web
UI — it generates the exact config block for your client (Claude Desktop,
Claude Code, or a generic one) with the right absolute paths for your clone
of this repo already filled in, plus a tool reference and troubleshooting
tips. Or see [mcp-server/server.py](mcp-server/server.py) directly.

## Data model / storage

SQLite (WAL mode) on a named volume, owned entirely by `api`. Parsed results
(file tree, plists, classes, symbols, disasm/decompile output, dynamic-trace
events) are persisted there; the worker re-extracts from the original
uploaded `.ipa` (also on a named volume) on demand rather than keeping raw
extracted trees around indefinitely.

## Known limitations

- **FairPlay-encrypted App Store IPAs don't work.** Decrypting one requires
  running the binary, which conflicts with "never execute untrusted
  uploads." Use a dev-signed, ad-hoc, or already-decrypted build.
- **Swift metadata recovery is partial** — good for Objective-C, best-effort
  for Swift's own type metadata.
- **Decompiler output won't match Hopper/IDA/Ghidra-desktop quality**,
  especially around `objc_msgSend` call-site resolution — it's r2ghidra
  wired into a web UI, not a from-scratch decompiler.
- **Dynamic-trace network bodies show as "binary (compressed)"** when an app
  gzips its request bodies (common — Firebase, Crashlytics, Branch, GA all
  do this by default); the agent deliberately doesn't attempt in-process
  gzip decompression via hand-built native `zlib` bindings, since getting a
  native struct layout wrong risks corrupting the traced process.
- **JADX output on heavily obfuscated/Kotlin-heavy APKs can be lossy**, same
  caveat any JADX-based tool carries — it's the same decompiler MobSF and
  most Android RE workbenches use, not a from-scratch one either.
- **First open of any class costs a full-dex apktool disassembly pass**
  (only for the smali half — JADX's `--single-class` mode is genuinely
  scoped to the one class you clicked). Fast in practice, but every distinct
  class's first open pays it, since nothing is cached across requests on the
  worker side — see [Android support](#android-support).
- Multi-user auth was deliberately deferred — this is a personal/small-team
  tool right now, not a multi-tenant service.

## Troubleshooting

- **A service fails to start / "port is already allocated"** — something
  else on your Mac is already using `8080`, `8000`, or `6379`. Find and stop
  it, or change the host-side port in `docker-compose.yml` (the left side of
  `"127.0.0.1:8000:8000"` — only the left side is safe to change).
- **A container was working, then a `docker compose up -d <service>` seems
  to do nothing** — Compose only recreates a container when it detects a
  config change; if you edited `docker-compose.yml` and it's not taking
  effect, force it: `docker compose up -d --force-recreate <service>`.
- **`frida-bridge` can't reach Redis/the API** — both need to be reachable
  from your host at `localhost:6379` / `localhost:8000`; confirm with
  `docker compose ps` that `redis` and `api` show a `127.0.0.1:...->...`
  port mapping, not just an internal one.
- **Dynamic analysis / MCP server specific issues** — see the
  troubleshooting sections in
  [frida-bridge/README.md](frida-bridge/README.md) and the in-app MCP setup
  page respectively.

## Responsible use

This is static- and dynamic-analysis tooling in the spirit of MobSF, JADX,
and Ghidra: point it at IPAs/APKs you own, that you built, or that you have
explicit authorization to test. The dynamic-analysis feature instruments a
real, running app on a real device — only do that against apps/devices
you're authorized to test, and only while you intend a trace to happen.
